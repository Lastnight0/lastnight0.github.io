# Avoid-Legacy

This is a personal project I put effort into for some months, it is actually based on the concept of a game I developed in c++, but much more feuture-packed and complex. It uses Phaser.js as game engine even though I made a very minimal use of it, just to load assests, manage scenes and manage frames. All the rest is made by hand, including the movement system,collision system, and each entity logic and behavior. 
The game has basically no graphics but even though I actually quite dig the extremely minimal look, the game is made as such as it can easily be added through Phaser.
The music is courtesy of Monolith Official Soundtracks and Swngyil YOON.

Hope you have fun!
